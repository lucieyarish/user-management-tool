# User Management System

## Task Description

* Design and create an admin page for user management
* The page will display an overview of users
* There will be a filter block in front of the overview, which will allow filtering by id, name, surname, status, and
  creation date (from and to)
* The overview should be paged
* The user overview will contain the following information: id, name, surname, status (active, deactivated), email,
  phone, date of creation
* It will be possible to perform the following actions on each user: activate/deactivate, edit, delete
